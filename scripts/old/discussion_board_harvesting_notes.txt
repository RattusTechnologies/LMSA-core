Current Capabilities

1.  Can harvest initial (top-level) message in 'thread'

2.  Can successfully capture and cycle through thread names (click and enter element link), and capture those names.
      Limitation: Length of thread list must be manually specified

3.  Able to return length of forums and cycle through independent of Forum Names



Present Issues

1.  Cannot harvest replies of a message.
      Reason: XPATH locations are not unique, and are heavily controlled by javascript
              Also the 'id' tag that identifies each message/reply is uniquely generated

2.  Can capture Images, but cannot associate them with a specific reply upon processing

3.  Cannot Return Forum Names, only a useless webdriver identification number is returned



CONCLUSION FOR CURRENT STATE/DEPLOYABILITY

  Currently I would deem this process possible but requires A LOT more work. There are too many early issues
to quickly generate scripts based on current source code functionality.

TIME LINE FEASIBILITY (0 to 10: 0 is Very non feasible timeline, 10 is very feasible)

  Navigating All elements:                    5
  Ability to capture date within elements:    3
